## today topics

- TDD and unit testing

- using mocha and chai

## automated
- mocha / chai
- saves time
-scales well
- allows for reptitive testing
- helps maintain focus
- todo list

## notes
- forEach doesnt work so well if you are planning to throw an array, bacause of the nature of callbacks being a function inside a function.
  - as opposed to a method  inside of a function
  - an error thrown in .forEach will just throw and error and ```continue```
- Mocha is a test Runner
- Chai is a library of better syntax for testing

- lookup object destructuring

- expect() is more linguistic than assert
