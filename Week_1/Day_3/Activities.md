 Everything js type not listed here are objects.

# What are objects
Objects:

 - Contain key-value pairs; each key maps to a value
 - Contain keys which are always strings (or symbols, but it's less common and not important right now)
 - Have unique keys; the same key cannot appear twice in an object
 - Have their keys point to values which can be of any type
